# microbe-ezd

I was inspired by the life engine sim (among other things) to play around with some concepts about simulating cells, microbes, and other organisms.

My original idea was something like, "what if you could simulate a pleasant sunlit sprint meadow in the rockies"

I'm going to try and keep my notes / stream of consciousness ramblings in [notes.md](./notes.md)
