I started stubbing some things out in javascript, but I don't think that's a good target on the whole, unless I want to render an html canvas. For now I'll stick with it because it's what's in my head; other options:

* love2d (lua)
  * Pros:
    * easy to run
    * lua is easy to prototype in
    * supposedly portable if I want to share it
  * Cons:
    * lua seems like it gets hard to manage at larger scales
* Go
  * I forgot the names of the frameworks, but there are several easy cli->2d rendering libs
  * Pros:
    * reasonably fast
    * compact memory (structs)
  * Cons:
    * Go
